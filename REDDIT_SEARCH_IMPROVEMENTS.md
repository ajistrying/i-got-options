# Reddit Search Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Unified Search Results Storage ✅
- **Database Migration**: Added new columns to `ticker_searches` table:
  - `unified_search_data` (JSONB): Stores all subreddit results in a single column
  - `search_metadata` (JSONB): Stores search metadata and statistics
  - `data_version` (INTEGER): Distinguishes between old (1) and new (2) data formats
- **Benefits**: 
  - Single database row per search session instead of multiple rows
  - Better query performance with GIN indexes
  - Easier to retrieve complete search results

### 2. Hot/New Posts Sorting ✅
- **Search Strategy**:
  - Fetches both "hot" and "new" posts for each subreddit
  - Hot posts: Last week's trending content
  - New posts: Last day's fresh content
  - Combines and deduplicates results
  - Custom relevance scoring: `(score + comments*2) / (age_in_hours + 2)`
- **Benefits**:
  - Fresher, more relevant content
  - Avoids stale posts that "relevance" sorting might return
  - Balances recency with engagement metrics

### 3. Comment Fetching ✅
- **Implementation**:
  - Fetches top 10 comments for the 5 most engaging posts per subreddit
  - Comments include: author, body, score, timestamp
  - Rate limiting: 300ms delay between comment requests
- **UI Features**:
  - Expandable comments section in post cards
  - Shows comment count and "Show/Hide Comments" button
  - Visual indicators for posts with comments (fire icon for hot, sparkles for new)
  - Comments displayed with author, score, and timestamp

## Technical Details

### Database Structure
```json
{
  "unified_search_data": {
    "subreddits": {
      "wallstreetbets": {
        "posts": [...],
        "count": 20,
        "fetched_at": "2025-01-25T..."
      },
      "options": {...}
    }
  },
  "search_metadata": {
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "subreddits_searched": ["wallstreetbets", "options"],
    "search_timestamp": "2025-01-25T...",
    "total_posts": 40,
    "total_comments": 150,
    "posts_with_comments": 10
  }
}
```

## Key Improvements
1. **Better Data Quality**: Hot/new posts ensure fresh, relevant content
2. **Richer Context**: Comments provide additional insights and sentiment
3. **Improved Performance**: Unified storage reduces database queries
