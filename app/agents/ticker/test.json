        "selftext": "Yesterday, I replied to a post (on TTG) where the OP was struggling with what to do on a covered call that had gone in the money. My reply was \"I'm always surprised people don't do Iron Condors in place of covered calls\" which sparked a bit of a discussion. I thought the discussion was worth a longer post and a bigger discussion here.\n\n**Covered calls** are like an entry drug for options. They are extremely straightforward and serve a very useful purpose. That intended purpose looks like this: 1) an investor owns the stock 2) they'd be willing to sell it higher. 3) If they sell OTM calls they have the chance to lower their cost basis before eventually being called away in the stock. 4) IOW, for those wanting to sell stock higher, a covered call strategy is a lot smarter than a GTC sell order in the stock.\n\nWhere covered calls get misused (IMHO) is as income generation against long stock. I would argue credit call spreads vs stock are better than covered calls, and I would take it one step further and argue that Iron Condors are better than both. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, let's start with the **expected move**. You may have seen me talk about the expected move as useful for strike selection. It's also useful for understanding something like a covered call strategy. The way an expected move generally works is that roughly 65-70% of the time the stock finishes at or inside that expected move. The other 30% that goes outside the expected move include some disproportionally big moves. The reasons are aplenty but think blow-out earnings moves, breakouts above resistance, crashes on bad news, etc. That 30% outside the move is much wider than it seems.\n\nSo now think about a covered call strategy where the call is at or just above the expected move. The math says it should work 2/3 times before being called away. Maybe even 3/4 depending on delta. The issue is that time it doesn't may be the big move higher. And if your strategy is income, rather than just a smarter way to sell your stock, that move you missed in the stock may be enough to wipe out any income you had collected leading up to that point.\n\n**Iron Condors vs Covered Calls for Income -** Here's a direct comparison of a covered call and a credit Iron Condor using Apple with a May 1st expiration as an example. The Expected Move would put the bullish consensus around $140 (currently trading $130). The 140 call is about 1.80.\n\n*If an investor bought 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) for $130. Then sold 1 May 21st $140 call at $1.80. That lowers their overall cost basis in the stock to $128.20 ($130.00 - $1.80).*\n\nIf the stock is at or below $140 on May 21st the investor would collect the entire $1.80. An ideal situation is if the stock goes higher, but not higher than $140. However, if the stock goes to $150. They are called away in the stock at 140. If they want to remain long the stock they need to buy to cover the call at a loss, in this example the call would cost at least $10 to close.\n\nAs an alternative, a credit Iron Condor is a strategy that looks to collect income by selling both an out-of-the-money credit call spread and an out-of-the-money credit put spread. Traders use credit Iron Condors for several purposes, often outside of stock ownership. The first is simply as a neutral or range trade, looking to receive a credit if a stock stays within a range. A second use is to short volatility, especially farther out in time. Here we'll discuss a third use, as potential income generation for a long stock position. One that does not necessarily cap potential gains in the stock. Here's an example, using the expected move for May 21st ([trade GIF](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/null.2021-04-08-15_24_45.gif)) via Options AI :\n\n*An investor owns 100 shares of Apple, bought for $130. They sell the Apple May 21st 115/120/140/145 Iron Condor at 1.50. This lowers their overall cost basis to $128.50.*\n\nIf the stock is between 120 and 140 on May 21st the investor would collect the entire $1.50 as added income to stock gains, or as a small buffer vs. losses. Here's how the options position looks on the chart:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/h0u83m1ma8s61.gif\n\nThis trade looks to collect 1.50 if the stock is between 120 and 140 on expiration, roughly the same as the 140 call sale that looks to collect 1.80. The difference is if the stock goes through that level, losses from the Iron Condor are capped at 3.50, whereas covering the covered call is undefined. The Condor see its max loss with the stock above $145, however, the long stock would resume gains as it moved above that level.\n\nFor example, if the stock is 150, the attempt at income via the Condor would have cost $3.50 vs gains in the stock, with the next $5 in the stock still captured as gains. The attempt at income via the covered call would cost north of $8, wiping out all the gains in the stock above $140.\n\nOr course, the Condor has risk in both directions. If the stock is below $115 on May 21st $3.50 is lost, adding to the losses in the stock. That differs from the covered call where the $1.80 credit is still collected. But if the intent is to be bullish, retain the stock over time, and add income, that occurrence would not be a deal-breaker unless the stock did a long sustained outsized move lower over multiple expirations.\n\n**Summary**\n\nA covered call is often thought of as a bullish strategy. And it is, up to a point. But the investor is capping potential gains in the stock. If the investor is simply looking to add income while holding onto a stock longer term, an Iron Condor could be a more pure expression of that view. Even comparing the Condor to a Credit Call Spread, which would share the ability for gains resuming in the stock w/o the risk of losses on the trade if the stock went lower, the Condor is still a more pure expression of income generation over time, as it is directionally agnostic, and collects more. Edit:  I've turned this post into a longer post with a little more detail over at [Learn](https://learn.optionsai.com/covered-calls-vs-iron-condors-for-generating-income-on-long-stock-an-example-in-apple-aapl/)\n\n**Update:**\n\nI somewhat cheekily picked a fight with a beloved strategy and that was intentional. My point on a covered call is there‚Äôs a lot more going on than meets the eye. And people miss the effect of lost opportunity cost. Which is real money. That‚Äôs why I used the example of Apple going to to 150. The covered call actually ‚Äúloses‚Äù money versus the condor there. Here‚Äôs a next level way to think about it:\n\nA covered call is .... actually a synthetic short straddle with some leftover stock.\n\nI‚Äôll explain. If I own a 1000 shares of a stock. And sell 10 calls. My resulting position is short 5 calls, short 5 synthetic puts, long 500 shares of stock. If I were to sell 20 calls. I am short a synthetic straddle 10 times with no long stock.\n\n(Short a call and long stock is a synthetic put). Wherever the strike is of the call is the center of the synthetic straddle. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs ‚Äúsomewhat bullish‚Äù if the call it OTM. And is fairly neutral if the call is ATM.\n\nIOW: When a stock gaps higher though a covered call that pain you feel is you covering a short straddle against your stock.",

It was sitting at 230 and now trading at 240ish. \n\nIf you were me, what would you have done? I have some options, to share and see what you guys can share with me (which I appreciate)\n\n1- I can sell another call spread for the same date for a different strike price, let's say 260/270. This way I collect some credit. And can apply it to close the original one earlier. This limit my loss and still has some risk.\n\n2- I can roll up an into the future for a credit, the future shall be 3 months at least. This is rolling to 265/275 for Dec monthly for a very small credit. This still has risks but a longer time frame, and the 265 is the max target stock price for AAPL this year.\n\n3- I can sit and wait. And when there is a dip in the next few days to close it for less than now. This has the risk if AAPL goes even higher, and even goes ITM.\n\n4- I can sell the same call spread (this time I will be getting much more credit) in the hope of stock going down, and with this strategy I kind of average my position. So less loss but very risky if you ask me. \n\nAny other options or any of these options that you would have used ? ",

Apple‚Äôs earnings were stellar, but the stock randomly tanked to 202 yesterday. I was still super bullish on AAPL, thinking it‚Äôs just a dip and would recover.\nHere‚Äôs the disaster: i got exercised ( in Interactive Brokers ) my short 220 puts EARLY, so I got assigned 1000 shares of AAPL while still holding the 10 217.5 puts. There were still 3 trading days until expiration! I was like, what the hell, why are they exercising this early? I thought about borrowing those 1000 shares to gamble on the rebound, paying the lending fee to Interactive Brokers, since I was so confident in AAPL‚Äôs recovery. But I chickened out, didn‚Äôt borrow, and instead closed everything yesterday to cut my losses.\nAnd then, because the market loves to screw me, today all this great AAPL news drops, and the stock‚Äôs back up to 220. I would‚Äôve been in the money if I‚Äôd just held on or gone through with borrowing the shares for ONE MORE DAY. I‚Äôm so pissed at myself for closing the position and at IB for that early exercise. Has anyone else been burned by early assignment like this? Should I have borrowed the shares and paid the fee to hold the position? What do you do when you get assigned early?

I love the stock long term. But I figured why not just sell calls weekly anyway. I can bring in a couple thousand bucks a year even if I'm being super cautious and conservative.\n\nBUT in that other thread, everyone was warning the person to not do it.  Because eventually you'll have your shares called away and be very unhappy.\n\nIs that really that much of a concern though? Yes, I'd be very annoyed if that happened, but I think it's pretty unlikely. I monitor my options daily anyway, and I'll just be sure to roll it up and out each week if I'm even REMOTELY worried about my shares being called away (like I just did on this past Thursday).\n\nSo, those of you who are more experienced, should I stop being cute and just keep my shares and cut it out?

        "selftext": "LAST MINUTE OPTION PLAYS FOR AAPL EARNINGS AND BEYOND\n\n¬†\n\nContinuing our eventful week of earnings and government reports, another great opportunity for investors comes from Apple. Personally, it is so difficult to tell which way the underlying will move, as Apple is one of the strongest and best companies in the world(heck just about everyone I know has at least some type of Apple product), but with economic uncertainty in the US and risk of costs drastically rising from tariffs, its impossible to know what will happen. That being said, we still came up with the best options strategies for whichever way it moves, and this could be the opportunity YOU have been looking for.\n\nOur goals were to limit downside risk, maximize potential profits(duh), and be in the money as soon as possible, rather than finding a trade that is only profitable near expiration. On this note, for you bulls out there, the first trade we found is a 250/270 Call Spread, expiring in June\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29lfp9wvd7ye1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5ad8032fb1911455083281c0ba40d582843641e\n\nThe cost of this trade is slightly higher than average over the past two years, but well cheaper than it‚Äôs been over the past month and a half, which I believe gives it quite good value\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/opkhip3xd7ye1.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=c00260cd72d206184bb86899e4b947069dbe2b8d\n\nSimilarly to many of the leading US equities, the cost of the underlying is high compared to the past couple years, but also well below its recent February high. The implications of this are for each investor to determine themselves, but there is a case to be made for movement in either direction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itki5a9yd7ye1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5f7857e65314e158b8996c473f8592790150b5\n\nThe heatmap of this trade shows the profitability probabilities, and we like this trade because it profits immediately on a positive movement in the underlying, while limiting downside risk to the cost of the premium only, making it a safe trade with the chance for very strong returns.\n\n\n\n¬†\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pntbuqwzd7ye1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=c144f3ad663a7b675e6db96a7177d9ed8b2cee12\n\nOn this flip side, for you bears out there looking to profit on a downward move, we found a 185/165 Put Spread, also expiring in June\n\n\n\n¬†\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvab5uy0e7ye1.png?width=3035&format=png&auto=webp&s=860af779a14bb5d7dfacbeecfc6c8aaf05f71ecb\n\nThe cost of this trade is similar top the positive one, in the sense that it is slightly higher than it was historically, but also cheaper than it‚Äôs been over the past few weeks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0prq7ra2e7ye1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=6afa7f8ad836f4b9496ed81b2507c0885fa9682a\n\nThe heatmap of this trade shows the strong profitability of this trade, showing how it profits immediately upon a downward move of the underlying, while at the same showing how risk is limited to the cost of the premium, giving it a high return chance with minimal negative risk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grhbdi85e7ye1.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9975e124b91f9fb972e1e03fc59a0eb58af04c6\n\nIn conclusion, this is a time of uncertainty in the US and global markets. This creates opportunities for investors to capitalize on volatility and make serious money. While I do not have a crystal ball and cannot say which direction AAPL or any stock will move, we can and do provide the best trades to make for each side and leave it up to you.\n\n¬†\n\nAnd remember, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs better to be lucky than good, so good luck to you all.",
